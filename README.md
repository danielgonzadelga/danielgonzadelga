Hi there, I am Daniel Gonzalez Delgado, a second year at the University of Toronto. 
I am currently pursuing my Undergraduate Degree in Computer Engineering.

My technical skills include proficiency in C/C++, and a strong understanding of Verilog. 
I am currently learning web development with React, and plan to develop skills in RISC-V 
Assembly and Algorithm Development in the coming months.

I have thorough knowledge of the design generation process, as well as strong teamwork and leadership 
skills. I already have two completed major team design projects, a proposed redesign of the Sidney Smith 
Building Fa√ßade at the University of Toronto, as well as system to reduce slippage in Orthopedic Knee 
Braces. I am currently in the process of developing a navigational tool (similar to google maps) in C++ 
alongside a team.

I have been a student athlete for most of my life, playing Water Polo alongside my studies. I traveled to 
Serbia in 2022 to participate in the FINA World Men's Youth Water Polo Championships, where I represented 
Team Canada. I am currently a part of the Varsity Water Polo Team at the University of Toronto, where I am 
a 2x OUA champion.
